For 0.9:

- support for setting hotkeys
- support for driver variables, not just boot variables.
- support for arbitrary device paths with -c (including guid parsing)
- audit for missing unparse_*_path() types.
  - verify/debug NVME code
- maintain a list of known GUIDs and print {vendor} instead of the full GUID
  - accept these for arbitrary paths as well.
- MS-DOS style extended partitions
